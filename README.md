Punnett Square (gene calculator)

# Purpose

This repository serves as an example of how to implement a Punnet Square calculator using JavaScript. This calculation is a very simple method for estimating the results of breeding animals together with the goal of specific trait expressions.

_"The Punnett square is a square diagram that is used to predict the genotypes of a particular cross or breeding experiment. It is named after Reginald C. Punnett, who devised the approach."_ - Wikipedia, Punnet Square

You can read more about the purpose via Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punnett_square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punnett_square)

For this specific project single gene visible traits from Ball Pythons were used.
